This is a simple Carousel component. It supports different layouts and items in slides, and it's also easy to use. 

## Usage
* create a container element, and put `Carousel` component inside it. The `Carousel` component will fit inside the parent component. So, it will get the `width` and `height` from the parent.
* `Carousel` component can have as many slides as you want. To add slides to `Carousel`, simply wrap the slide in a `CarouselSlide` component, and add them to `Carousel` component as child.

See `src/containers/main/Main.js` as an example.

## About the code
This is not a complete project. It's just and example of a `Carousel` component, so you will see many components without any logic. Accordingly, there wont be any logical test for them. They are only checked to `matchSnapshot` to prevent some unwanted changes.

You can find the `Carousel` component in `src/components/carousel` folder.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The rest of the Readme comes from CRA.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
